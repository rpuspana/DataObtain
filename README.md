### How to use

For testing this project you can use the excel files provided by me in the _input folder.

In this present version of the application you will need Visual Studio to launch it.
To do this:
1. Build the code and press Start in Visual Studio.
2. When Excel prompts you for a workbook to open, either choose a blank one to create your own Excel file or you can go in the project's _input folder and open one of the files there.
3. Search for the DataExtractor tab on the Ribbon.
4. Click it and choose the first option in the window that will appear. The the rest of the process should be self-explanatory.
