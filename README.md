Make sure that Excel supports COM Addins added to it and let's the Addin interact with Excel.

For testing this project you can use the Excels provided by me in the _input folder

In the current form your need Visual Studio 2017 to launch the application.
To do this:
1. Build the code and press Start in Visual Studio.
2. When Excel prompts you for a workbook to open, either choose a blank one to create your own Excel file or you can go in the project's _input folder and open one of the files there.
3. Search for the DataExtractor tab on the Ribbon.
4. Click it and choose the first option in the window that will appear. The the rest of the process should be self-explanatory.
